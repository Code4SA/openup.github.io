description: Societies are successful when communities and governments work together. Our goal is a harmonious working relationship between government, civil society and common people. We want society to be involved in governance and hold government to account for promises and delivery. One of our tools that contributes to this is <a href="/tools/municipalmoney.html">Municipal Money</a>, designed to inform citizens on their local authority's financial performance which allows comparisons between municipalities.
