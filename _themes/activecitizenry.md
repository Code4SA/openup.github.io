description: Our vision of an informed society is one in which people can take action to improve their situation and that of others, making use of the mechanisms of governance to effect change. We work towards this vision by creating tools such as <a href="/tools/openbylaws.html">Open By-laws</a> and <a href="/tools/opengazettes.html">Open Gazettes</a>. These help South Africans be more informed about the national and local legislation that govern them.
