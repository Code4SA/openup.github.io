description: Data, especially government data, should be freely available and open. It should be free to be used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose. Our vision is for Open Data to be the standard in South Africa, with governments, companies, and organisations making their data freely available for anyone to examine and interrogate. Take a look at our <a href="/tools/dataportal.html">data portal</a> for interesting datasets and search for corporate data through <a href="/trace">TRACE</a>.
