statement: I am true believer in the power of design and its ability to make valuable and potentially empowering information more accessible to those who need it most.<br><br> The process of addressing need through the discovery, curation, and enrichment of freely available, but often well hidden, data, is deeply appealing to me. I am constantly excited by the opportunity to apply my experience and the principles of design to further improve these tools and enhance their impact and reach.
