biography: Having entered the public service domain at just 20 years old, I started this journey working as an Administration clerk at Hanover Park, because I had lived there all my life. After my studies I needed to find a way to apply my skills within my community. 15 Years later, having worked within all three spheres of our South African Government, from the Health sector, Marine & Coastal Management, Arts & Culture, Local Government, to finally deciding its time to take my passion for community development and empowerment to the Non Government Sector. I believe transformation needs to happen almost compulsory at two levels, spatially and educationally. Social Inclusion is the vision, but requires champions in all walks of life, understanding the context of where our country is, clearly mapping out the way forward to promote and sustain human development, in so doing ensuring accountable citizens, and an accountable government.
