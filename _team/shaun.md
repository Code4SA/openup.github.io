statement: "Don’t focus on the goal, focus on the process that will get you there. We all want world peace. We all want equality. We all want love and attention. But these grand abstractions distract us from the small (and sometimes boring) steps that are needed to get there. Solving the world’s great social problems is easy in yourhead, but reality is a whole other box of frogs. I believe, as an organisation, OpenUp is a space where I can collaborate with smart, passionate, and caring people who are able to simplify and distil these impossible goals into essential actionable projects that tackle these problems one little bit at a time. I am trying to take these seemingly insignificant steps forward every day so that in decades I can look back at a life of compounding social interest, and show that I helped change the world for the better.
