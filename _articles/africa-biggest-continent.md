In a speech to members of the African Business Leaders Forum in December 2015, South Africa’s president Jacob Zuma told them that Africa is the “biggest continent in the world”. (No, the honours goes to Asia – as the presidency said in a correction of Zuma’s statement in January 2016.)

Zuma then added: “All continents put together will fit into Africa.”
