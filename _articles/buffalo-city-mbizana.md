On a windy Wednesday in Buffalo City in October, OpenUp partnered with SALGA and volunteers from civil society to liberate the by-laws of Buffalo City and Mbizana municipalities, putting them online to make them easier to find, read and share on openbylaws.org.za.

As [we’ve written about before](https://openup.org.za/articles/cape-agulhas-bylaws.html), by-laws are important local legislation that regulate many aspects of the day-to-day lives in our local communities. The Constitution allows municipalities to pass by-laws to regulate, amongst other things, informal trading, liquor trading hours, pet ownership, streets and parking, and provisioning of water and electricity. 

Getting access to a full collection of up-to-date by-laws for a municipality is often difficult or time-consuming, even though Section 15 of the Municipal Systems Act, 2000 requires municipalities to put up-to-date copies of their by-laws on their websites. During a by-laws liberation day we get together with community volunteers to put the by-laws online, free for everyone.

On the day, we were joined by representatives from Buffalo City Municipality, the newly-established Buffalo City Community Policing Forum, SALGA, Mbizana Municipality and the Mbizana street traders association.

We started with a brief introduction to the OpenByLaws.org.za platform, which makes it pretty easy to import batches of existing legislation and get them ready to publish on the website. Attendees then split into pairs and worked through the by-laws for Buffalo City and Mbizana, capturing the publication and amendment information as well as the text of the by-laws. The work was then reviewed and prepared for publication.

Finally, all the by-laws for the two municipalities were put online, free for everyone to find, read and share:

## Get your municipality’s by-laws online

Do you know what your liquor trading hours are, how your municipality supports informal traders, or how many pets you’re legally allowed to own?

Access to your municipality’s by-laws is essential. If you’d like OpenUp to help put your municipality’s by-laws online, please email us at [bylaws@openup.org.za](mailto:bylaws@openup.org.za).
