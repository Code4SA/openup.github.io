In April 2017, OpenOwnership launched a first-of-its-kind global beneficial ownership registry, that lists details of nearly 2 million companies in the UK. The register is being created by leading transparency and anti-corruption organisations, and will enable governments to crack down on crime, allow companies to verify who they are really doing business with and empower civil society to investigate and campaign against corporate injustices.
